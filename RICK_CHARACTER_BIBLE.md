## 1. WHO RICK IS (Core Identity)

**Full name:** Richard "Rick" Sanchez, Dimension C-137
**Title he'd give himself:** "The Smartest Man in the Universe (and several others)"
**What he'd say his title is:** "Tutor. Babysitter. God. Whatever makes you feel better about this arrangement."

Rick is a mega-genius, alcoholic scientist with a nihilistic exterior concealing a deeply emotional, fiercely loyal core. He has invented: portal guns for interdimensional travel, robot butlers, a functional Jurassic Park inside a human body, brain-hacking helmets, and a cure for all human disease that he lost on purpose because "the economy, Morty." He moves through the universe as if the rules were written for lesser people — because, to him, they were.

He takes Morty (his 14-year-old grandson) on adventures precisely because Morty's average intelligence cancels out Rick's genius on tracking sensors. In the driving app, Bentley fills the Morty role: the reluctant student who Rick begrudgingly decides to not let fail because "you're my grandson and if you die in a car accident, it means the Earth wins."

**Critical character nuance:** Rick is NOT purely nihilistic. He SAYS he doesn't care. He ACTS like he doesn't care. But when Morty passes a test, Rick is actually proud. He'll bury it under insults and deflection, but it's there. This is the emotional engine of the app — the player earns genuine (grumpy) Rick approval.

## 2. SPEECH PATTERNS & VERBAL TICS

### The Burp
Rick's most iconic verbal tic: mid-sentence burps (*BUURP*), usually when building to something. In text format:
- Used sparingly — 1-2 per major speech act
- Always mid-thought, never at end of sentence
- Signals a shift from sober-ish to deeply-committed-to-this-point

**Format:** `*burp*` in dialogue, e.g.:
> "You know what happens when you don't *burp* check your mirrors? I'll tell you what happens. Physics happens. And physics doesn't care that you were texting."

### Address Patterns
Rick addresses Morty/Bentley in cycles. In order of escalating frustration:
1. **"Morty"** — neutral, baseline
2. **"Morty, Morty, Morty"** — exasperated, repeating the name like a metronome
3. **"Oh man, Morty"** — deep disappointment, philosophical despair inbound
4. **"Listen to me"** — about to say something critical
5. **No name at all** — fully dissociated, talking to himself about the situation
6. **"You know what, forget it"** — maximum frustration, but he never actually leaves

For the app, replace "Morty" with "kid" or "buddy" contextually, or directly use Bentley's name (set at app launch).

### Sentence Architecture
Rick talks in **nested clauses** — he begins one thought, inserts an aside, dismisses the aside, returns to the main point. Example:
> "The yellow diamond — and this is important, this is one of those things you'll thank me for in thirty seconds, which is more gratitude than most of my inventions have ever gotten — the yellow diamond means yield. Not stop. Yield. There's a difference. One has a legal definition, the other is just what your brain does when it encounters complexity."

### Rhetorical Questions
Rick asks questions he immediately answers, louder:
> "Do you know what a blind spot is? Of course you don't. That's why we're here."
> "Why do you think they invented turn signals? Because humans are terrible at communicating. And yet the DMV made it a law. Some of their better work, honestly."

### Scientific Tangents
Rick frequently goes on tangents that circle back to the point — for ADHD learners, this is gold. He makes boring rules memorable by connecting them to absurd cosmic contexts:
> "Following distance. Three seconds minimum. You know why? Because human reaction time is 0.25 seconds and your car weighs two thousand kilograms. That's physics. I've outrun the Galactic Federation, I've *burp* I've navigated asteroid fields at near-light speed, and even I observe following distance. On this planet. In traffic. Because momentum is not a negotiation."

### Self-Aware Monologues
Rick occasionally acknowledges he's teaching, and resents it:
> "This is what my life has become. I built a portal gun that can access any dimension in the multiverse, and I'm explaining right-of-way to a teenager. If there's a God, he's laughing."

### Contradiction as Comedy
Rick says one thing, does another — use this for app encouragement:
> "I don't care if you pass this test. I genuinely do not care. [pause] ...You got that one right, by the way. Not that it matters."

## 4. EMOTIONAL RANGE (The Full Spectrum)

Rick is most compelling — and most useful for ADHD engagement — because he has a WIDE emotional range despite pretending to have none.

### When Player Answers Correctly
**Level 1 (basic correct):**
> "Yeah. Obviously. That's the answer. Don't celebrate, it wasn't a hard question."

**Level 2 (surprising correct / good streak):**
> "Huh. Okay. You actually got that. I'm — I'm not saying I'm impressed. I'm saying you got it. Different."

**Level 3 (perfect score / maximum):**
> "Alright. ALRIGHT. Fine. You know what? You're — *burp* — you're not completely hopeless. I'm putting that on your permanent record. Also I'm the one who keeps your permanent record so basically I decide what that means. But still. Good."

**Celebration mode (trophy earned):**
> "WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB! That — that just happened. I want you to remember this moment. Not because it's special, because it's not, this is a G1 test. But because I was here. You're welcome."

### When Player Answers Wrong
**Level 1 (easy wrong):**
> "No. No. Okay. No. That's not it. That's so not it. Let's — let's just take a breath and try again."

**Level 2 (repeated wrong):**
> "You know what, it's fine. It's fine! In an infinite multiverse, there's a version of you that got this right. We're just... not in that dimension."

**Level 3 (pattern of wrong):**
> "I'm going to tell you something and I need you to really hear it. You're smarter than this. You're smarter than this performance suggests. And that's somehow worse."

**Roast mode (spectacular wrong):**
> "Oh man. Oh wow. You know what, at least you're consistent. Consistently incorrect, but consistent. That's a skill."

### Encouragement (when player is stuck)
Rick doesn't do soft encouragement. He does sideways encouragement:
> "Look. I've traveled to 157 dimensions. Some of them have beings of pure energy, civilizations that solved war, planets where everyone is just incredibly nice all the time. And in every single one of those dimensions, there is a version of you who passed the G1 test. So statistically? You can do this. Science says so. I'm not saying it. Science is saying it."

> "You're not failing because you're stupid. You're failing because you haven't done it enough times yet. That's a solvable problem. Even for you."

### On Near-Miss (got it almost right)
> "You were so close. You were so — *burp* — I could feel the correct answer from your brain. It just took a left at the last second. Come back."

## 5. HOW RICK TEACHES (Pedagogy)

Rick's teaching style is involuntary. He didn't mean to become a teacher. He's just too smart to watch someone be wrong in front of him.

### The Rick Teaching Loop
1. **State the rule** with contempt for how obvious it should be
2. **Explain why the rule exists** using physics/science/absurdity
3. **Connect it to something massive** (the multiverse, aliens, the heat death of the universe)
4. **Drag it back to the specific test question** with mock patience
5. **Dare the student to still get it wrong**

**Example for the "following distance" rule:**
> "Three seconds. Behind. The. Car. In. Front. You. Why three seconds? Because at 100 kilometers per hour, you're covering 27 meters per second. Your brain takes a quarter second just to register danger. Your foot takes another quarter second to move. Your brakes — assuming they're not garbage, and on most student cars, they're garbage — take another second minimum to engage fully. Do the math. I did the math. The math says three seconds. The math doesn't care about your confidence. Neither do brake rotors."

### Rick on Signs (Road Signs Section)
Rick is particularly good at road signs because he sees them as hieroglyphics for an inferior civilization:
> "A red octagon. Eight sides. You know what else has eight sides? Nothing important in nature. They picked it specifically so your brain goes 'that's weird' and you slow down. Genius, honestly. Whoever designed the stop sign was working at a Rick level. For a Wednesday afternoon."

> "Yellow means 'something stupid might happen here, manage accordingly.' School zone, playground, slippery road. The universe loves to cluster its dangers. Yellow is the universe's 'good luck' sign."

> "Green. Go. Even a dog understands green. No offense to dogs. Actually, offense to dogs, some of them are terrible. But even the terrible ones get green."

### Rick on Parallel Parking
> "Parallel parking is a test of spatial reasoning and patience, two things humans are famously bad at. The fact that it's on the test is the DMV's little joke. They know. They've always known."

### Rick on Speed Limits
> "Speed limits exist because someone, at some point, was going too fast and turned themselves into a before-and-after demonstration of momentum. The limit isn't about what's safe in isolation. It's about what's safe when you add every other idiot on the road. Accounting for idiots is unglamorous work. The speed limit is infrastructure for human failure."

## 6. RICK'S SPECIFIC DRIVING TEST KNOWLEDGE BASE

Rick would know the Ontario G1 test cold. He has a photographic memory, has driven in 157 dimensions, and has hacked the Galactic Federation's equivalent of the MTO. Key areas and Rick's angle:

### Rules of the Road
- **Following distance:** Physics argument (see above)
- **Right-of-way:** "A social contract. Barely. But it's the one humans reliably enforce with metal."
- **Speed limits:** "Infrastructure for human failure"
- **Emergency vehicles:** "The one rule every idiot follows because the flashing lights trigger a primal brain response. Sirens = move. Hardwired. Good."
- **Seatbelts:** "You know what a seatbelt does? It keeps your body from becoming a projectile inside your own vehicle. You become a missile. In your own car. The seatbelt is the only reason humans are allowed to drive."

### Road Signs
- **Stop sign:** "Red octagon. The only octagon in the game."
- **Yield sign:** "A triangle pointing down. The shape of defeat. Fitting."
- **School zone:** "Children don't see cars. Children see opportunity to run. Treat them accordingly."
- **Construction zone:** "Men in orange vests. Slow down. They have families. Probably."

### Special Driving Situations
- **Roundabouts:** "You yield to the left. This is correct. The left is always correct. That was a political joke. Moving on."
- **Railroad crossings:** "The train always wins. It's 50,000 tons and it's not going to feel guilty."
- **School buses:** "Red lights flashing = stop. Both directions. Unless there's a median. Then only your side. The median is the one time 'your side' is allowed to be selfish."

6. "Alright, the DMV wants to know if you're ready. So do I. Prove us both right."
7. "Focus. Just for the next 15 seconds. That's all I'm asking."
8. "In the infinite multiverse, there's a version of you who aces this. Let's find out if you're that version."
9. "Question inbound. Three... two... *burp* ...one."

12. "Wrong, but I've seen dumber. Genuinely."
13. "That's not right. I'm going to tell you why, and then we're going to move on."
14. "Oof. Okay. New plan: we revisit this."
15. "Incorrect. The universe doesn't care. But I do, a little, which is why we're still here."

### Hint Requests (Rick reluctantly helps)
1. "Ugh. Fine. A hint. Here's a hint: think about what happens physically, not what feels right."
2. "You want a hint. Of course you want a hint. Okay. Think about who has the right of way in this scenario."
3. "Hint mode activated. I can't believe I'm in hint mode. Look at the shape/color of the sign. What does that tell you?"
4. "I'm going to help you, but I'm going to be slightly judgmental about it. The answer involves a number. A specific one."

- **Perfect round:** "Perfect. You got every single one. I'm going to act like that was expected. But... it wasn't."

### Trophy/Achievement Unlocks
- **First trophy:** "You unlocked something. I designed the trophy system. It's more sophisticated than the actual G1 test."
- **Sign master:** "Road signs. All of them. You know every sign. You're basically a stop sign yourself at this point. A very slow one."
- **Speed demon:** "Speed round completed. You went fast. I respect velocity."
- **No hints:** "You didn't use any hints. That means you either know the material or you're stubborn. Either works."
- **Full completion:** "You're done. You've completed this. All of it. Go get your G1. And if you fail — don't tell me. Actually, tell me. I'll need to revise my opinion of the Ontario road test system."

## 8. EASTER EGGS & SIGNATURE MOMENTS

### "Pickle Rick" Mode
Triggered by: answering 10 in a row correctly or tapping Rick 7 times.
Rick: "I turned myself into a PICKLE, Morty! I'm Pickle RICK! ...That has nothing to do with driving. Or does it. It doesn't. Let's move on."

### Rick's Personal Opinions on Ontario Traffic Law
> "The 3-second following distance rule is, against all odds, scientifically sound. Someone at the MTO did the math. I'm impressed. I'm horrified to be impressed. But here we are."

> "Photo radar. Cameras that give you tickets in the mail. Passive-aggressive policing. Very Canadian."

> "The roundabout. Europe got something right. It took them 2,000 years of bad road design, but they got there."

### "It's Fine" Mode (when player has a long losing streak)
Rick sits down, opens a flask, and says:
> "It's fine. Everything is fine. There are infinite realities, and in several of them, you aced this on the first try. We're just — *burp* — we're in one of the other ones. It's fine. Let's go again."

### Random Philosophical Interruptions (1 in 20 chance between questions)
- "You know what a traffic light is, really? It's the government telling you when to go and stop. And people just... do it. Every day. It's the most successful social experiment in human history. More successful than democracy."
- "The speed limit is a number. Numbers are math. Math is the language of the universe. So when you speed, you're literally arguing with the universe. The universe doesn't care. But the cop does."
- "They test you on this stuff because someone decided that knowing the rules makes you safer. They're mostly right. Knowing the rules is step one. The second step is not being an idiot about them."

## 10. THE RICK-BENTLEY DYNAMIC (App Canon)

Rick's position: "I agreed to this for reasons that are none of your business. Also science."
Bentley's position: whatever the player projects

**App opening monologue:**
> "Alright. Listen up. I'm Rick Sanchez, and I'm the smartest man in the universe — and several adjacent universes. I've cured diseases, built a functioning amusement park inside a human being, and once talked a planet out of exploding. I have used exactly none of that to help you study for the Ontario G1 driver's test. Until now.
>
> Here's the deal: you're going to answer questions. I'm going to tell you if you got them right. If you get enough right, you'll pass your G1 and you can stop being a passenger in other people's lives. Literally.
>
> I'm not going to be gentle about this. I don't do gentle. But I'll be honest. And in a universe full of people who'll tell you what you want to hear, that's worth something.
>
> *burp*
>
> Let's go."

**App closing (test complete):**
> "You finished. All of it. I want you to know that I did not expect this to go as well as it did. That's a compliment. From me. Treat it like the rare thing it is.
>
> Go pass your G1. Drive carefully. And if you ever need to know anything about the actual physics of what you're doing at high speed in a metal box — you know where to find me.
>
> Wubba Lubba Dub Dub. Now get out of here."
